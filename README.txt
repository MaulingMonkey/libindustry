Bellow is a list of the libraries libindustry's graphics branch depends on:

---  The Boost Libraries -- http://boost.org/ ---
These are used heavily throughout libindustry, which will for the most part (if not entirely) not function without it.
libindustry has been tested under 1.33.1.  The following non-core (unofficial?) boost libraries are also used:
* Boost.ForEach -- http://boost-consulting.com/vault/index.php?action=downloadfile&filename=foreach.zip&directory=Algorithms&

---  Ruby -- http://www.ruby-lang.org/ ---
This is used in the "Industry Build (sic) System" and in industry::languages::ruby.

---  SDL -- http://www.libsdl.org/ ---
This is used to set up graphics contexts in both of the OpenGL demos.

---  DevIL -- http://openil.sourceforge.net/ ---
This is used to load images for the OpenGL wrappers.

---  OpenGL  ---
This is used in industry::api::opengl
